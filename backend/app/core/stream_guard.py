"""Per-user cap on open SSE streams.

The chat/agent/research/training stream endpoints hold an HTTP connection open
for the whole generation, so one client can pin many connections for free.
This module keeps a per-user in-memory count of open streams and refuses new
ones past settings.MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS with a 429. In-memory is enough: the
backend is a single container (no horizontal scaling), and the count must be
exact per process anyway.
